I don't want to live in a world without fresh produce, where everything is created and modified in a lab. Natural food should be affordable and available to everyone. Because of a pesticide called neonicotinoids, which coats the seeds used in much of the agriculture industry, one-third of the US beehives are being decimated every year. The European Union has banned the pesticide and now the US needed to do so immediately.
